# Web Development Fundamentals :books:
In this module, I started learning about `Unix` systems and the `Shell`, and I wrote my first scripts.

I learned about code versioning tools and started using `Git` and `GitHub` on a daily basis.

In addition, I learned the basics of how the internet works, created my first pages with `HTML`, styled them with `CSS`, and used `JavaScript` to make them dynamic.

I learned how to develop __responsive__ pages with Flexbox and __accessible__ with semantic HTML, use libraries and frameworks, create asynchronous code with JavaScript ES6 and unit tests with `Jest`.
